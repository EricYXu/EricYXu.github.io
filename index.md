Hi! I am Eric, a student at Harvard College. I am studying computer science and statistics while dabbling in biology and chemistry. When I am not working, I enjoy playing the alto saxophone, running around the Boston area, and reading. As of this week, I am learning about **juggling**, **diffusion models**, and **epistemology**.
